        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            This project was part of a university-level Human-Computer Interaction course with a focus on
            <strong>design activism</strong>. Our goal: to create an inclusive, safe, and discreet digital
            intervention to support women experiencing intimate partner violence—particularly targeting digital
            and emotional abuse.
        </p>
        <p>
            In collaboration with Uppsala Women’s Shelter, we focused on how digital design can play an ethical and empowering role.

        <h2>Design Challenge</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Create a subtle, safe user experience that protects the user’s identity and behavior.</li>
            <li>Design for Gen Z and foreign-background women – two underrepresented but vulnerable demographics.</li>
            <li>Present information in discreet, digestible formats while avoiding potential risks.</li>
        </ul>

<p><h2>Approach &amp; Research</h2>
<p>
We conducted a series of workshops, competitor analysis (e.g. Safe Horizon, RAINN), and synthesized
feedback from survivors and experts. Key takeaways included the importance of subtlety, language
accessibility, and mobile-first thinking.

        <h2>Solution Overview</h2>
<p><h3>1. Instagram Ads</h3>
<p>
Two ad types were created: a Valentine’s Day-themed attention grabber, and an informative story
series. Both were visually appealing but subtle, designed to avoid raising suspicion.
</p>

<p><h3>2. Enhanced Leave Page Button</h3>
<p>
We redesigned the “Leave Page” button on the Uppsala Women's Shelter site, increasing its visibility
and making it context-aware. We also proposed a browser history disclaimer on first page load.
</p></p>
<p><h3>3. Hidden Support Chat</h3>
<p>
A business-mimicking chat disguised as a shopping assistant, allowing for discreet communication.
Includes auto-reset and a panic “exit chat” shortcut.

        <h2>Ethical Considerations</h2>
        <p>
            Every design decision was filtered through an ethical lens. How might a user be endangered? What
            happens if their abuser sees the screen? Our aim was to <strong>hide support in plain sight</strong>.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Muted color palettes to avoid visual alarms.</li>
            <li>Language minimized to avoid flagging attention.</li>
            <li>Secondary messaging only visible on further interaction.</li>

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>
            This was one of the most meaningful projects I’ve worked on. It challenged me not only as a designer,
            but also as a human. It taught me the importance of designing <strong>for real people, in real danger</strong>,
            and how technology must support—not expose—them.
