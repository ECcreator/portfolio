            <h2>Designing for Safety and Empowerment</h2>
            <p>
                This project was developed as a form of design activism in support of the Uppsala Women's Shelter. Our team sought to create digital experiences
                that protect victims of domestic and digital abuse while empowering them with discreet tools for help and information.
            </p>
            <p>
                Drawing inspiration from user-centered design and safety-first thinking, we developed a redesign concept for the shelter's website,
                including an improved emergency exit button and a secure, temporary chat system. Additionally, we explored using Instagram ads
                to reach vulnerable groups through subtle, visually engaging campaigns.

                <h2>Challenge</h2>
                <p>
                    Victims of domestic abuse often face digital surveillance and lack safe, anonymous ways to seek help. The challenge was
                    to design a discreet, mobile-friendly user experience that can reach younger audiences (especially Gen Z) and protect
                    users in high-risk situations.

        <h2>User Research & Insights</h2>
        <p>
            Research included interviews, web analysis, and feedback sessions with peers and instructors. Victims often delete their browsing history,
            use fake businesses to seek help, or rely on visual cues. Users responded positively to discreet designs and suggested multi-language support
            and chat anonymity features. We also investigated ad targeting strategies to ensure campaigns reach vulnerable groups via Instagram stories.

        <h2>Design Concepts</h2>
        <p>
            We developed two key concepts:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Website Enhancements:</strong> A redesigned homepage with a more prominent exit button, a disappearing chat system, and a safety disclaimer on load.</li>
            <li><strong>Instagram Story Ads:</strong> A Valentine’s-themed campaign with soft, emotionally resonant imagery that avoids triggering language. Slide 1 grabs attention; slide 2 reveals emotional abuse signs.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Feedback & Refinement</h2>
        <p>
            Peer and instructor feedback emphasized the need for originality and clear focus. Based on that, we refined the ads to avoid explicit
            references and created a fake-business chat interface prototype. We also explored algorithm-based targeting and multilingual options
            for ads, especially for women with foreign backgrounds or substance abuse vulnerabilities.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            This project demonstrates how design activism can be used to create digital experiences that prioritize safety, discretion, and social impact.
            By merging UX design principles with targeted outreach, we created a prototype that not only protects victims but also connects them
            to help in a subtle, respectful, and empowering way.
