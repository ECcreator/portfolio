        <h2>Credibilis: Reimagining Credible News on Social Media</h2>
<p><p>
Credibilis is a social news platform designed to empower users to engage critically with the news they consume.
Developed as part of a UX design course, the project explores how digital experiences can be designed to support
trust, transparency, and reflection in the age of algorithm-driven media.
</p></p>
<p><p>
In an environment where misinformation spreads quickly and credibility is often unclear, Credibilis gives users
tools to verify sources, compare perspectives, and understand the context behind the headlines. The app combines
social features with expert contributions to build a community where news is not just consumed but explored and
discussed with integrity.
</p></p>
<p><p>
The goal was to create a platform where users feel informed rather than overwhelmed, and where meaningful
interaction replaces shallow engagement. From early user research to interface prototyping and testing,
the Credibilis project showcases a human-centered approach to designing for information literacy and digital trust.

                <h2>Challenge</h2>
                <p>
                    Young people increasingly turn to social media for news, but the platforms they rely on are often driven by algorithms
                    that amplify misinformation and reinforce echo chambers. This makes it hard for users to trust what they read or
                    encounter diverse perspectives.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our guiding question was: How can we design an engaging social media (news) platform that fosters credibility and encourages critical thinking?

        <h2>User Research</h2>
        <p>
            We began by exploring how users currently interact with news on social media. Through workshops and interviews,
            we found that most users feel overwhelmed by conflicting information and lack confidence in determining what content
            to trust. Many expressed frustration over opaque algorithms and the absence of clear credibility indicators.
            These insights laid the foundation for our design, which focused on giving users more control, transparency, and
            agency in the news they engage with online.

        <h2>Understanding Our Users</h2>
        <p>
            Based on the diversity of needs and goals revealed in our research, we developed three representative personas. Lisa is a
            student who wants clarity and balance in her feed, without being bombarded by too many conflicting perspectives. Trevor, a
            mid-career professional, values efficiency and wants trustworthy content he can scan quickly during his day. Amelia, a
            domain expert, needs a platform where her expertise can be trusted and used to validate the credibility of posts. These
            personas helped shape the design features and interaction patterns in Credibilis.

        <h2>The Challenge</h2>
        <p>
            The rapid spread of misinformation and the growing influence of algorithms have created a trust gap in how users engage with
            news online. For many, social media is both a source of information and a source of confusion. Users often feel passive,
            manipulated, and unsure about how to verify what they read. Our challenge was to design a platform that would feel familiar,
            like a social app, while introducing new features that promote credibility, transparency, and critical thinking — without
            making the experience feel cumbersome or overly technical.

        <h2>Design Process</h2>
        <p>
            We followed a double diamond approach, beginning with broad exploration and narrowing into defined concepts. Our ideation
            workshops used affinity mapping and dot voting to identify recurring themes like credibility, verification, transparency,
            and algorithm bias. Initial paper sketches evolved into Figma prototypes, which we tested across multiple iterations. We
            also used a MoSCoW analysis to prioritize essential features. The final design blends fact-checking tools, profile
            transparency, adjustable algorithm filters, and expert contribution in a seamless and intuitive interface.

        <h2>Usability Testing and Key Insights</h2>
        <p>
            To evaluate our prototype, we conducted usability testing using Maze. Participants interacted with key features such as
            fact-checking, credibility indicators, source validation, and algorithm controls. Tasks like checking a news article’s
            credibility took longer in early tests, but ratings for ease of use and perceived usefulness increased after refinement.
            Users appreciated the ability to explore post transparency, although some elements like icons and multi-step fact-checking
            needed further simplification and clarity. Familiar design patterns helped ease onboarding, but some icons (like the three-dot
            menu) caused confusion and will be rethought in future iterations.

        <h2>Feedback from Seminar</h2>
        <p>
            During our seminar presentation, participants offered valuable critique on both interaction design and the conceptual framing
            of Credibilis. While the AI robot icon was praised for its clarity, and the overall UI felt intuitive, many noted that credibility
            cues like upvotes might feel more like popularity signals than meaningful indicators of truth. There was also a desire for deeper
            explanation of how fact-checking works, what each expert can verify, and what the credibility percentages actually represent.
            Some participants questioned whether the interface resembled social media too closely, given its focus on news, and suggested
            that engagement features like comments might need to be less prominent to reinforce the platform’s journalistic mission.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            Credibilis proposes a new way to experience news — one that combines the social and intuitive nature of familiar platforms with
            mechanisms that foster transparency, critical thinking, and trust. Through research-driven design and iterative testing, we created
            a concept that doesn’t just fight misinformation, but empowers users to question, verify, and explore news on their own terms.
            Although still a prototype, Credibilis offers a blueprint for how digital platforms can evolve to meet the information needs of the
            future.
