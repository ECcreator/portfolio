            <p class="subtitle">UX Designer and HCI Researcher</p>
            <p>
                Hi, I’m Esther Castro. I study Human-Computer Interaction at Uppsala University, building on a background in Systems and Computer Science from Stockholm University.
            </p>
            <p>
                I care deeply about crafting digital experiences that are meaningful, accessible, and grounded in empathy. My design work often reflects a love for simplicity and clarity, with inspiration drawn from nature and everyday human moments.
            </p>
            <p>
                I enjoy working through research and iteration to shape intuitive and inclusive interfaces. Whether I am mapping a journey, designing a prototype, or gathering user feedback, my goal is always to create with thoughtfulness and care.
            </p>

        <h2>Design Values</h2>

        <p>
            My approach is calm, human-centered, and focused on bringing clarity and ease into people’s lives. I believe in designing with purpose and with care, always looking for ways to make digital experiences more joyful and inclusive.
